# Letter Shuffle Animation for a Menu

<span style="color:red">Used for learning purpose.
There are some of my notes commented out in JS files.\
<span>

### <span style= "color:blue"> **Codrops articles and tutorials are great and professional. You will see in their JS/CSS code all new stuff implemented. Personally I love that they are using BEM convention in CSS, JS Classes, code packages, JS architecture for better organizing of code... :heart: :heart: :heart:**<span>

A little animation for a big menu where the letters of a word shuffle to become the first letter of each menu item.
